# Codist

Codist is a syntax memorization tool.

The files in this folder are supposed to be the bare minimum to go through a language or framework's syntax.

They must be typed by memory by hand and the "score" will be generated through diff files.

The `reference` folder contains the reference files, the `exercise` folder contains the rewrites.

## Rules

Read reference, close reference and write on equivalent file by memory, peeking only when needed.
Then run a diff between the files and execute the scripts.
